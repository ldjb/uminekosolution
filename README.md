# GabeZhul's solution to Umineko no Naku Koro ni

So, after I began replaying Umineko from the beginning, I decided to combine pleasure with work and start writing up the best explanations I could figure out (or find on the net). This is not as much about the grand mysteries of the series as a focused work on the murders and other "small" mysteries. I also think it will be a good substitute for going down memory lane for those like me, who are/were really turned away from a re-reading by the sheer size of the series, or simply didn't have the time to re-read the series just to verify things. :)

**That said, there are going to lots of very, VERY heavy spoilers, from the entire series as a whole even in the first chapter, so please, don't even think about reading this if you haven't read the entirety of the series already.**
