# Episode 1: Legend of the Golden Witch
## Culprits
* Yasu is the killer
* Nanjo provides fake diagnoses and cover-up
* Genji provides the muscle for moving the bodies and cover-up
* Maria places the letters and provides the magic circles
* Eva and Hideyoshi also know some details and provide cover-up, especially when it comes to the "death" of Shannon

Furthermore, although a red truth forbids poison gases (*"There was no poison gas, there was no drowning, there was no death by suffocation!!"*), I still presume most of the victims' food or drinks were drugged to make Yasu able to overpower them. Also, the Red Truth says nothing about gases that do not cause death, or substances such as formalin and chloroform that could possibly knock out the person, or at least disorient them to make them easier to deal with.

## First Twilight
### Description
Six bodies were found in the tool-shed, their faces smashed apart, with a magic circle on the shutter. The six were Krauss, Kyrie, Rudolf, Godha, Rosa and Shannon. Out of the six, only Shannon was surely identified thanks to her ring. The shed was locked by a key that was in the servants' quarters.

### Red Truths
1. *"the identities of all unidentified corpses are guaranteed"* (Used by Lambdadelta in ????? for Episode 1.)

### Explanation
The method of the murder is irrelevant. Based on the blood-stains in the dining hall, the actual killing caused only minor bleeding, so it was either a relatively small stab wound, or, more likely, blunt force trauma directly to the head. Either way, the end result is the same.

### Further Details
The faces were destroyed to protect Yasu's identity as Shannon/Kanon and to keep the modus operandi consistent. It is also notable that neither George (the person closest to her who was not in on the murders) nor Battler (our only reliable narrator) have seen her face, only Hideyoshi.

However, it is quite possible that Eva and Hideyoshi are forced or bribed into becoming Yasu's accomplices at this point, thus it is not only possible that Hideyoshi lied and Shannon's corpse weren't even there, but highly probable.

The funniest thing though is that the Red Truth regarding unidentified corpses specifically allows Shannon's corpse to be non-guaranteed. One one hand, it is described as being only half-smashed and thus she was not "unidentified". On the other hand, there was no "corpse" to begin with (as in, Yasu was either still alive or there was no body at all to begin with). In short, Yasu dodges the Red not once but twice!

### Special Circumstances
Maria's involvement was made especially obvious by the magic circle, which was more than likely drawn by her on the first place, thus explaining why she knew so much about it. The same goes for all the other magic symbols throughout the episode. The circumstances relating to the shed's key and the locked mansion doors are irrelevant, as the servants have the keys for both.

## Kinzo's disappearance
### Description
In the morning, Eva "sealed" the door to Kinzo's study with a receipt so that she would know if the door was opened afterwards. When they later enter the room again and Kinzo was missing, she questions Natsuhi about how Kinzo could have disappeared without opening the door.

### Method
Kinzo was never in his room to begin with, so there was no-one to leave on the first place. I think it is pretty self-explanatory.

## Second Twilight
### Description
Eva and Hideyoshi were killed in their own room. They had to cut the door-chain to get inside, and in there they were found with stakes in their foreheads. Eva was on the bed, out of view from the door, while Hideyoshi was in the shower.

### Red Truths
1. *"Both were killed by another person!"* (This is referring to the second twilight of Episode 1.)
1. *"It is not the case that, after the construction of the closed room, one of them committed suicide after committing murder!"*
1. *"Furthermore, the murder was carried out with both the victim and the perpetrator in the same room!"*
1. *"No method exists for the perpetrator to commit murder from outside the room!"*

### Explanation
The method of the murder is, once again, irrelevant. It was shown that, through the unreliable narration, the servants could have murdered the two any way they wanted to (though Yasu probably just shot them) and then stake them and position their bodies however they wanted.

### Further Details
The stakes were drilled into their bodies postmortem, or rather they were played in the gun-wounds, the effect is the same.

The closed room is solved by the unreliable narration. Contrary to what is "shown", the following is what really happened: They opened the door with the master key, Kanon cut the chain, they killed the two, and then pretended to find the corpses alongside the rest of the family and that they only just recently "had to cut the chain" to get inside.

## Fourth Twilight
### Description
Kinzo's body was found in the furnace of the boiler room, with a stake in his forehead. His body was charred and could only be identified by his extra toe.

### Explanation
Kinzo was not murdered, he has been dead for a while thanks to natural causes. His body was hidden in the furnace and was recently doctored by adding the stake to his forehead.

## Fifth Twilight
### Description
Kanon was found on the floor of the boiler room, bloodied with an apparent wound on his chest, with the bloody stake next to him.

### Red Truths
1. *"Kanon did not die in an accident!"* (This refers to Kanon's death in Episode 1.)
1. *"Kanon did not commit suicide"*
1. *"All of the survivors have alibis! Let us include the dead as well!! In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed Kanon!"*

### Explanation
Kanon wasn't murdered either. He faked his death with the help of Nanjo's fake diagnosis. No one has actually seen him being stabbed, with the stake in his chest, and people only judged how serious his injury was based on the bloodstain on the stake. There is no objective observation about him being actually wounded.

## The Witch's Third letter
### Description
Everyone is locked in Kinzo's study, when a letter appears on the table while they weren't looking.

### Explanation
Maria put the letter there. She was the one who pointed it out on the first place, and the goal of the letter was to single the accomplices out so that they could get out of the study.

## Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Twilights
### Description
Genji's, Kumasawa's and Nanjo's bodies were found in the lounge, their faces smashed and the bodies mangled. Maria was found facing the wall and singing, and she says she was told to do so by the witch. The door was locked from the inside.

### Red Truths
1. *"Maria, who was in the same room, did not kill them!"* (This is referring to the deaths of Genji, Nanjo, and Kumasawa in Episode 1.)
1. *"Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are not killers."* (This refers to their deaths in Episode 1.)
1. *"And of course, the three were killed by other people!"*
1. *"Regarding the unidentified corpses, all of their identities are guaranteed. Therefore, no body double tricks exist!"*

### Explanation
The three were killed by Yasu. It is entirely possible they were drugged beforehand, though not necessary. Maria was on the sidelines during all this.

### Further Details
The door was locked by Maria from the inside to create the illusion of a locked room.

## Natsuhi's Death
### Description
Natsuhi appeared to have had committed suicide by shooting herself in the forehead in the hallway. It appeared there is no one left on the island who could have done it.

### Red Truths
1. *"Natsuhi was killed by another person!"* (This is referring to Natsuhi's death in Episode 1.)
1. *"There are no unidentified corpses, and all of the survivors have alibis!"*
1. *"The bullet buried into Natsuhi's forehead was not fired from Natsuhi's gun!"*
1. *"The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled!"* (This refers to her death in Episode 1.)

### Explanation
There was more than one gun to begin with, and so Yasu was easily able to kill Natsuhi while the cousins were locked inside the lounge. By the time they got out, Yasu was gone, replaced her gun with the killer weapon, and so it appeared that Natsuhi shot herself once the cousins found her.
